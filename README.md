[![Codeship Status for wildwood/presto-code](https://app.codeship.com/projects/d7b117c0-8a54-0137-c948-2e6a8e925a93/status?branch=master)](https://app.codeship.com/projects/354799)

(codeship is not my ideal choice, since it has limited support for Java 8, but Java 7 is sufficient for this project.  I would lean toward Jenkins in a production environment.)
